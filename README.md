* LAWMAKING TRACKED  EVERY STEP OF THE WAY
* centralized information helps people stay informed
* automatization can help citizens track and monitor legal initiatives
* making a closed and complex environment accessible to all
* increasing accountability among legislators

[See the project live](https://czl-web.surge.sh/)

With dozens of institutions involved in the process and incomplete information fragmented across a myriad of websites, it is almost impossible
for a regular citizen to follow the long process by which a proposal becomes law.

In these circumstances it is almost impossible to speak of active engagement in the legislative drafting process on the part of the citizens.

Right now people and entities interested in tracking legislation initiatives have to visit over 29 websites daily for updates. This places a large burden on legal
professionals, civil society actors and private corporations which are investing time and resources daily to stay up to date with legislation
initiatives. Once CeZiceLegea will be launched these costs will be reduced substantially.

CeZiceLegea aims to keep citizens informed at any time about changes in legislation and make them active participants in the legislative drafting process. Users will be able to track and
monitor proposed legislation through all the approval stages and be notified of the changes made.

As an extra feature, to give a sense of the wider context, CeZiceLegea will also allow access to current consolidated legislation.

## Built With

- Python 3
- Django 1.10.6

## Deployment

```shell
createdb <dbname>
echo create extension hstore | psql <dbname>

mkdir <deploydir>
cd <deploydir>
git clone https://github.com/code4romania/czl-api repo

virtualenv --python=python3 venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r repo/requirements.txt

cd repo
cp czl/base/localsettings.py.example czl/base/localsettings.py
# edit localsettings.py as required
./manage.py migrate
```

### To run the project as a WSGI app:

- make sure PYTHONPATH includes `<deploydir>/repo` (or chdir to it),
- use the virtualenv,
- and use `[<deploydir>/repo/]czl/base/wsgi.py` as the WSGI application file.

### Web server configuration:

In production you should set `STATIC_ROOT` appropriately in settings,
and serve the static files via the web server.

```shell
./manage.py collectstatic
```

### To run the development server:

```shell
cd <deploydir>
. venv/bin/activate
cd repo
./manage.py runserver
```

### Token generation:

You can generate tokens using the admin interface. To do so, create a superuser:

```shell
./manage.py createsuperuser
```

then, using your browser visit the admin interface and (optionally) create
a regular user under `/admin/auth/user/add/` and a token under
`/admin/authtoken/token/add/`.
